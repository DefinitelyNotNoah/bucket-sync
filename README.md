### üåç BucketSync, a bucket-based environment synchronization resource for FiveM, built for developers.

BucketSync is a designed to give you complete control over your server's environment, providing a server-authoritative system for synchronizing time, weather, and other world states across all players.
Its core purpose is to allow for instanced zones using FiveM's routing bucket system, enabling different players to exist in separate "worlds" with unique environmental conditions simultaneously.

### ‚ú® Features
 * **Server-Authoritative Synchronization:** All state changes are controlled by the server, providing a single source of truth and preventing client-side manipulation.

 * **Routing Buckets**: Create and manage multiple routing buckets, each with its own independent time, weather, and game rules. Ideal for minigames, instanced housing, or separate roleplay scenarios.

 * **Dynamic State Management**: Time progresses naturally in each bucket, and server admins can dynamically change any state variable (like weather) on the fly.

 * **Anti-Tampering**: BucketSync includes a built-in integrity check that ensures players remain in their assigned routing bucket, preventing them from going into other buckets unauthorized, or tampering with environment values that differ from what is set on server-side. A main loop on the server periodically sends state data to clients in each bucket via a VerifyIntegrity event, ensuring everyone stays synchronized.

### üå¶Ô∏è Synced States
* Weather
* Time
* Time Scale
* Blackout
* Friendly Fire

## Client Events
  Events follow the format `[RESOURCE_NAME]-[CLIENT/SERVER]:[EVENT_NAME]`

`Sync-ClientEvent:VerifyIntegrity`  
Sends server data to clients to synchronize their environment to the values the server has set.

`Sync-ClientEvent:SetTime [hour: int] [minute: int] [second: int]`  
Sets the client time

`Sync-ClientEvent:SetWeather [weatherType: string]`  
Sets the client weather. View weather types here https://docs.fivem.net/natives/?_0x29B487C359E19889

`Sync-ClientEvent:SetTimeScale [amount: float]`  
Sets the time scale for a client. Any value less than 1.0 will slow the game down. No change will occur with values past 1.0. Minimum is 0.0.

`Sync-ClientEvent:SetBlackout [allLights: boolean] [includeVehicleLights: boolean]`  
Sets blackout condition for client. Will turn off all the lights in-game.

`Sync-ClientEvent:SetFriendlyFire [condition: boolean]`  
Set friendly-fire option for client.

## Server Events
You will mainly be executing server events. Client events are executed inside Sync-ClientEvent:VerifyIntegrity on a 2-second interval server-side. Meaning that no matter what client events get executed, it'll always be overridden by server-side state after 2 seconds.

`Sync-ServerEvent:InitBucket [bucket: int] [lockdownMode: [strict | relaxed | inactive]`  
Initializes a routing bucket server-wide. 2nd argument is lockdown mode, and is represented as a string.

`Sync-ServerEvent:SetPlayerToBucket [playerId: int] [bucket: int]`  
Assigns a client's routing bucket to the bucket provided.

`Sync-ServerEvent:SetTime [bucket: int] [hour: int] [minute: int] [second: int]`  
Sets the time on a routing bucket.

`Sync-ServerEvent:SetWeather [bucket: int] [weatherType: string]`  
Sets the time on a routing bucket. View weather types here https://docs.fivem.net/natives/?_0x29B487C359E19889

`Sync-ServerEvent:SetTimeScale [bucket: int] [amount float]`  
Sets the time scale on a routing bucket. Any value less than 1.0 will slow the game down for every client inside the bucket. No change will occur with values past 1.0. Minimum is 0.0.

`Sync-ServerEvent:Blackout [bucket: int] [allLights: boolean] [includeVehicleLights: boolean]`  
Sets blackout condition on a routing bucket. Will turn of all lights for all clients in-game.

`Sync-ServerEvent:SetFriendlyFire [bucket: int] [condition: boolean]`  
Set friendly-fire option on a routing bucket.


## Server-Side Commands
Commands that were made for testing.

`initbucket [bucket] [lockdownMode: strict | relaxed | inactive]`  
Initializes a routing bucket server-wide. Must be used before utilizing the bucket.

`setbucketpop [bucket] [population: int]`  
Set's the population on a routing bucket, any over 0 is considered true.

`setbucketlockdown [bucket] [lockdownMode: strict | relaxed | inactive]`  
Set's the population on a routing bucket, any over 0 is considered true. 2nd argument is lcokdown mode, and is represented as a string.

`setbucket [playerId: int] [bucket: int]`  
Assigns a client's routing bucket to the bucket provided.

An server-side lua file demonstrating usage has been provided at `example/command-test.lua`
```lua
RegisterCommand('settime', function(source, args, raw)
    local bucket = args[1]
    local hour = tonumber(args[2])
    local minute = tonumber(args[3])
    local second = tonumber(args[4])

    print('Set time: ' .. hour .. ':' .. minute .. ':' .. second)
    TriggerEvent('Sync-ServerEvent:SetTime', bucket, { hour = hour, minute = minute, second = second })
end, true)

RegisterCommand('setweather', function(source, args, raw)
    local bucket = args[1]
    local weather = args[2]

    TriggerEvent('Sync-ServerEvent:SetWeather', bucket, weather)
end, true)

RegisterCommand('settimescale', function(source, args, raw)
    local bucket = args[1]
    local timeScale = tonumber(args[2])

    TriggerEvent('Sync-ServerEvent:SetTimeScale', bucket, timeScale)
end, true)

RegisterCommand('setblackout', function(source, args, raw)
    local bucket = args[1]
    local all = args[2]
    local vehicleLights = args[3]

    TriggerEvent('Sync-ServerEvent:SetBlackout', bucket, { all = all, vehicleLights = vehicleLights })
end, true)

RegisterCommand('setfriendlyfire', function(source, args, raw)
    local bucket = args[1]
    local condition = args[2]

    TriggerEvent('Sync-ServerEvent:SetFriendlyFire', bucket, condition)
end, true)
```
